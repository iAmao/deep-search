### Reporting issues

To report a bug, request a feature, or even ask a question, make use of the GitHub Issues

1. **Search for existing issues.** Your question or bug may have already been answered or fixed,
be sure to search the issues first before putting in a duplicate issue.

2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.** If you are reporting a bug, make sure you
also have a minimal, runnable, code example that reproduces the problem you have.

3. **Include a live example.** After narrowing your code down to only the problem areas, make use
of [jsFiddle][fiddle], [jsBin][jsbin], or a link to your live site so that we can view a live example of the problem.

4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include browser version affected, your OS, version of
the library, steps to reproduce, etc. "X isn't working!!!1!" will probably just be closed.

### Setting Up

To setup for making changes you will need to take a few steps, we've outlined them below:

1. Ensure you have node.js installed. You can download node.js from [nodejs.org][node]. Because
pixi uses modern JS features, you will need a modern version of node. v6+ is recommended.

2. Fork the [deep-search.js][deep-search] repository, if you are unsure how to do this GitHub has a guides
for the [command line][fork-cli] and for the [GitHub Client][fork-gui].

3. Next, run `npm install` from within your clone of your fork. That will install dependencies
necessary to build deep-search.js


### Making a Change

Once you have node.js, the repository, and have installed dependencies are you almost ready to make your
change. The only other thing before you start is to checkout the correct branch. Which branch you should
make your change to (and send a PR to) depends on the type of change you are making.

Here is our branch breakdown:

- `development` - Make your change to `development` if it is a *non-urgent* bug fix or a backwards-compatible feature.
Your change should be made directly to the branch in your fork, or to a branch in your fork made off of
one of the above branches.

### Testing Your Change

Ensure you write adequate test cases for new features or bug fixes

### Submitting Your Change

After you have made and tested your change, commit and push it to your fork. Then, open a Pull Request
from your fork to the main deep-search.js repository on the branch you used in the `Making a Change` section of this document.
